# -1-Project-plan-starter
Project Plan Starter offers a structured framework to initiate and manage a single project. It provides a clear project plan, milestone checklists, issue tracking, and a sensible .gitignore, ensuring reproducibility, clarity of roles, and efficient onboarding.

- Blank Markdown Plan — a fully customizable project-template-plan.md containing structured placeholders for objectives, research questions, milestones, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. This version is ideal for users who want to adapt the framework to any project by filling in their own details

- Python Script Plan — a project_plan_starter_for_phyton_and_github.py file that generates a structured project plan programmatically. It demonstrates how GitHub and Python can be combined to scaffold a reproducible workflow, including environment setup, version control practice, and documentation. This version is especially useful for those who prefer automation and want to export or extend the plan into other formats.
