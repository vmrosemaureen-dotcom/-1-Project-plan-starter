# Project Plan Starter
--
## Overview

**Project topic**: Personal monthly expense analysis  
**Owner**: Rose  
**Duration**: 3 weeks  
**Audience**: Self and close stakeholders
---
## Objectives

- **Primary objective**: Understand monthly spending patterns and identify 2–3 areas to reduce expenses.  
- **Secondary objectives**: Create simple visualizations and a reproducible notebook.
---
## Research Questions

- **Primary question**: Which expense categories consume the largest share of monthly budget?  
- **Secondary questions**: Are there recurring subscriptions that can be canceled? How does spending vary by week?
---
## Success Metrics

- **Quantitative**: Identify top 3 categories that account for ≥50% of monthly spending.  
- **Qualitative**: Notebook is clear and reproducible; insights are actionable.
---
## Milestones

1. **Initialization and Setup** — due: Week 1 Day 1  
   - Tasks: create repo `personal-expense-insights`, add `project_plan.md`, `README.md`.  
2. **Data Collection** — due: Week 1 Day 3  
   - Tasks: export bank/credit card CSVs, combine into `data/raw/`.  
3. **Cleaning and Preprocessing** — due: Week 1 Day 7  
   - Tasks: standardize categories, handle missing dates, save `data/clean/expenses_v1.csv`.  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis** — due: Week 2 Day 3  
   - Tasks: create category pie chart, weekly trend line, save notebook `notebooks/eda.ipynb`.  
5. **Analysis and Recommendations** — due: Week 2 Day 7  
   - Tasks: identify subscriptions, calculate potential monthly savings, draft recommendations.  
6. **Documentation and Handover** — due: Week 3 Day 1  
   - Tasks: finalize `README.md`, prepare 3-slide summary, commit final notebooks.

## Deliverables

- **Clean dataset**: `data/clean/expenses_v1.csv`  
- **Notebooks**: `notebooks/eda.ipynb`, `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`  
- **Visualizations**: category breakdown, weekly trend chart  
- **Documentation**: `project_plan.md`, `README.md`, 3-slide summary

---
## Acceptance Criteria

- Steps to reproduce cleaning are in `notebooks/eda.ipynb`.  
- Top 3 categories identified and documented with numbers.  
- At least one actionable recommendation with estimated monthly savings.

---
## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Missing or inconsistent transaction categories — **Mitigation**: manual mapping table and simple rules.  
- **Risk**: Limited time — **Mitigation**: focus on top 3 categories only.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Lead**: Rose (owner and analyst)
